Blog generator for Markdown files on Github (Hacked up)

Run 'ant' to get all the dependencies (all 4.2MB of them...) from maven via Apache Ivy (which you also need to have installed).

Then just run the program as normal Java file, and it will create HTML pages for the markdown files on my blog.

TODO
====
* Specify blog url from the command line
* Optional template files found in CWD to use.
* Plugins 
* Generate index file - maybe via plugin on a template file?
* Optional config, such a files per page on the index page - maybe via plugins?
